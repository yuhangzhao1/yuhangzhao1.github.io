<i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> We open sourced [VRSight](https://github.com/MadisonAbilityLab/VRSight?tab=readme-ov-file), a AI-driven pipeline that makes any VR scenes accessible to blind users through a <em>posthoc</em> proxy, as well as [DISCOVR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UWMadAbility/DISCOVR), a dataset of VR objects that includes 30 Object Classes across 6 categories. Kudos to [Daniel Killough](https://dkillough.com/) who leads this effort! <br>
